# face-detection-with-age
This project uses TensorFlow in Python for face detection and age prediction. A pre-trained CNN model, such as MTCNN, is used for detecting faces in images. Once a face is detected, another CNN model predicts the age of the individual. This application can be used for security systems, demographic analysis, and personalized user experiences.
